    "Polymers are macromolecules formed by stacking smaller monomeric units, via a polymerization reaction. It is the molecular chain assembly and topology, that are posing great challenges for both molecular modeling and computational simulations. In recent years, significant progress has been made towards developing softwares and computer algorithms, which have the computational power to create an optimal simulation environment that could both aid and complement _in vitro_ new polymer based material design.$^1$ \n",
    "Expressing each atom of the chain by an unique set of 3D cartesian coordinates, constitutes an accurate mathematical model for representing a polymer structure. However, these coordinates are not readily accessible and they must be computed from the internal properties (bond lengths, bond angles, and torsions within adjacent bonded atoms). Hence, both the prediction of this properties and the conversion parametrization pose fundamental issues in molecular modeling and there is extensive research being done in the area. Here two main computational approaches for extracting the cartesian coordinates of staked monomeric units will be reminded, an adaptation of the USPEX evolutionary algorithm and the natural extension reference frame (NeRF) algorithm. The later constitutes a mathematical model that is extensively applied in several scientific fields and robotics, while the first one treats each monomeric unit as a building block, with a fixed connectivity, resembling the solid state unit cell structures by assigning each such polymer a corresponding space group.$^{2-3}$\n",

    "The aim of the following program is to read a txt file, containing __cartesian coordinates__ of a <font color = 'grey'>__simple hydrocarbon molecule__</font> and <font color = 'green'>__return all of its internal properties in the form of a Z matrix__</font>. This matrix will ulteriorly be extrapolated to create a new Z matrix corresponding to the addition polymerisation of a given monomer. The <font color = 'green'>___internal coordinates of the polymer Z matrix___</font> are then supposed to the revers operation, being transformed into a new set of cartesian coordinates corresponding to the <font color = 'darkgreen'>__3 D__</font> polymer structure. They will be stored under the name of your molecule followed by <font color = 'limegreen'>\"_polymer_backbone_cartesian.txt\"</font>. The structure can be visualised by copy pasting the output txt file into the <font color = 'darkorange'>__Avogadro Cartesian Editor__</font> for example. However, only the backbone atoms are considered, meaning the addition of all substituent atoms such as, in the case of PVC, Hydrogen and Chlorine, must be added using an additional software function such as Chem3D from ChemDraw. \n",

    "The Z matrix format will start at the first central atom in the backbone, leaving the rest of the line unoccupied, then the first column will be filled will all of the other backbone central atoms and then the atoms they each bond to, following the exact order they were stored in `\"NL_new_indices\"`. This will constitute the first column of the Z matrix. To start filling the second column, one should consider that in order to have N - 1 bonds the filling must start with line 2, meaning that the only neighbor carbon in the backbone neighboring 'C2' is 'C1'. Similarly filling of the fourth and sixth columns start on the third and fourth line respectively, but several aspects need to be taken into account when filling them.\n",

    "__Assess initial pattern starting from the terminal cental atoms__\n",

    "Considering the final goal is to restore the cartesian coordinates of a polymer starting from its Z matrix it is essential to start by first covering all of the bond and dihedral angles formed between consecutive central atoms and then consider the role played by the other atoms (substituents). Hence, within the closed interval `[2, \"Number of central atoms = len(str_at_type_central)\"]` the same method used for filling the first column is applied systematically to both columns four and six, within the specified bounds.\n",
    "Starting with the line on which the first column begins with an other atom (substituent) the second column must contain their corresponding central atom which will vary in steps of `\"len(str_at_type)\"`. Hence, there are algorithm variations to account for the degree of nesaturation and molecular structure, for example in the case of hydrocarbons the end carbon atoms form 3 bonds with 3 different other atoms (<font color = 'darkred'> Note: chemically identical atoms are considered to be distinct, as they represent different cartesian points</font>). The middle atoms will thus form 1 bond less with an other atom (substituent) and in the case of unsaturated molecules with 1 NE, 2 bonds less. Hence, the following sintax was developed, relying on the number of bonds formed with other atoms (substituents). \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to fill the fourth and sixth columns the ends of the molecule are different in the idea that internal properties are computed with respect to the consecutive bonded central atoms. This can be seen in `\"Ends\"` for the terminal atoms and in the added sintax `\"Z_matrix[k_1+(Var_4[len(str_at_type)-2]-Var_4[1])][3] = NL_new_indices[len(str_at_type_central)-1]\"` for the initial atom. The middle Z matrix lines for which the other atoms (substituents) are communicating via two bonded central atoms were computed using `\"MIDDLE\"`.\n",

The coordinates thus obtained were introduced in the <font color = 'darkorange'>Avogadro Cartesian Editor</font> and a linear structure was obtained. Both the coordinates and the structure are illustrated in the figure below. The triple bonds are eronatly placed by the molecular visualiser, possibly due to the lack of substituents, but overall the backbone structure does obey the __Volume Exclussion Principle__, denoting that the NeRF algorithm implementation was successful. The substituents were manually introduced and an energy minimisation was performed on the new structure, under the Force Field and Geometry Optimisation parameters displayed in the figure. Although the optimised structure assigns the substituents correctly, the backbone chain retains its initial cartesian induced rigid conformation, which can pose issues when considering more complicated monomeric structures.\n",

    "The `class \"New_uv_n_ABC\"` was created to translate the NeRF mathematical interpretation into code, via a set of vectorial calculations steps. The function `\"Initial_pozition\"` has the role to extract the internal coordinates from the returned Z polymer output and thus return the coordinates of $\\tilde c_k \\space/\\space C_4$ within SRF. Each point must first be rotated at the origin and then translated from SRF into the cartesian real space. The function `\"New_coord_A\"` was created towards this scope where its entry variable $\\tilde c_k \\space/\\space C_4$ represents the output of the `\"Initial_pozition\"` function and `\"at_C3_real\"` is the $C_{k-1}$ translation vector, which coincides with $C_3 = [0,0,0]$ for the first atom of the polymer chain. After each step \"at_C3_real\" takes the value of the previously computed  $\\tilde c_k\\space /\\space C_4$ and the new vector is translated by it. By repeating the process at each step the function \"New_coord_A\" ensures the translation vectors add up, imposing a linear growth on the backbone chain, while keeping the distance between neighbored atoms identical with the one imposed by the bond length internal coordinate (for the cases considered here this will always be 1.52 Å). This proves the validity of the algorithm as no two atoms will occupy the same point in space being in good agreement with the Volume Exclusion Principle. Hence, it is expected that any deviations from the expected geometrical structure of the polymer will stem from the choice of internal coordinates rather than their conversion to cartesians.\n",

    "Since the distance between any linked atoms is given by the actual bond length between them, the new code version should be capable of switching between applying the `\"Initial_pozition\"` function for the backbone atoms, as it currently does, and simultaneously apply it in jumps for the substituent of each translated central atom. This would ensure that the substituent is translated from the current coordinates of the central atom by a vector of $\\space \\space $ $\\space \\space$ $\\space \\space$ $\\space \\space$__CentralAtom---SubstituentAtom__ bond length magnitude. The computation must then switch back on the backbone algorithm, while ignoring the previous translation, possibly by adding it on iteration step k and substracting it at k+1."

The polarity of the $[-CH_2-CF_2-]_n$ repeating units is imposing an additional constraint on the molecular chain assembly, due to the monomer presenting a strong dipole moment induced by the high elecronegativity of the florine atoms, $F^-$.

    "The current version of the program serves as a prototype for a simulated polimerization environment, which has been proven efficient at reading a file of xyz atomic coordinates for any linear molecule and returning the internal coordinates in a Z matrix format. The final goal was, for a small category of molecules (\"polymerisable molecules type1\"), to identify the internal coordinates that a polymer derived from the initially calculated monomer would have and convert them back into cartesian coordinates to obtain the polymer structure. The current code development only allows mapping of the backbone chain atoms and completely ignores the substituents, which as discussed can alter the predicted conformation even in the case of small monomers. An improved version would allow both inputs of branched and cyclic molecules, thus expanding the category of monomers, for which a full polymerisation outcome can be predicted. Two main limitations were identified towards this direction, namely the prediction of internal coordinates and mapping of the chain substituents. While the latter poses a mathematical algorithm development issue , for which progress is currently being done, the first limitation is of a scientifically chemical nature, steaming from the empirical approach used in assigning the internal coordinates of the polymer. While the current algorithm was proven efficient for small simple polymeric models, as exemplified for both PE and PVC, the model will break with incresing the complexity of the molecule. Moreover, it fails to predict the polymeristion outcome for more than 15 monomers due to the limited storage capacity of most ordinary computers. Thus, the aim is to implement molecular mechanics algorithms, and derive the internal coordinates from the first principles, by identifying an appropriate choice of force fields via optimisation and parametrization. If proven efficient, the renewed version of the program would have the potential to run the simulations through a computer interface suitable for performing molecular dynamics calculations, and thus allow any number of monomers to be introduced, while also predicting the polymer ability to coil and its interactions with the solvent.
